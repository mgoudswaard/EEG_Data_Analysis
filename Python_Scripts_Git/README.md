# Running the code

Use `python3 -m venv .venv` to create the virtual environment for the project.

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

VSCode will default to the virtual env when you open the folder. Epic!

If you want to open and run on the command line then `cd` into the directory and run

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

which will activate the virtual environment.


To install the packages for the slicer, use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
