This folder contains the scripts and functions to arrange data, calculate POW values, subsequent TRPs and plot the associated Spider plots.

Task related power (TRP) is a measure of the power at each electrode, and is calculated using ther following equation:
    TRP = log(POW_activation) - log(POW_reference)

POW is defined as the mean square value of the voltage captured from the electrode across the period of interest, in microvolts.

Some of the primary literature on the use of TRP for analysis of design tasks is:
